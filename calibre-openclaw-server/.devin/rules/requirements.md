# Requirements Engineering Rule

`REQUIREMENTS.md` is the living source of truth for product, architecture,
operations, and validation expectations.

Update requirements whenever a change affects:

- user-visible behavior;
- API contracts or data models;
- architecture and layer responsibilities;
- authentication, authorization, or security posture;
- deployment, queues, workers, observability, or runtime constraints;
- acceptance criteria or test strategy.

Good requirements must be clear, testable, consistent with the implementation,
and explicit about constraints. Avoid vague language, conflicting decisions, and
implicit architecture. When requirements change, review the README for alignment.
